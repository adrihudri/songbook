[F]honest[C]ly you were [G]less than a [Am]prince
[F]i could [C]say that a[G]gain
[F] what we [C]had was little [G]more than a [Am]glimpse
of the [F]things that we [C]wanted back [G]then

[Am] no one [F]likes to [C]find the [G]one who
[Am]they thought was [F]lovely was a [C]flash in the [G]pan
survey the scene well the break was clean
hell that may be true and yet the losses were grand

{soc}
and the [C]worst part is oh the [G]worst part is
oh the [Am]very worst part [F]is
[C] i will always [G]love you any[Am]way [F]

left myself sitting pretty and dumb
sitting right on the rails
the service train came and set us apart
although now iâ€™m still getting your mail

you seem to have found a way to bring me down
to make me see just how the problem is mine
if you would like to be a person making me
feel worse well you can get behind me in line

{soc}
and the worst part is oh the worst part is
oh the very worst part is
i will always love you anyway
{eoc}
