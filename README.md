# SONGBOOK

This is my chordbook. Most of the songs are either sourced from transcriptions
people have given me, or they are transcriptions which I have done myself.

These aren't intended to be official, or completely accurate. They're just the
way I learned to play these songs. If you enjoy them, great. If not, too bad.

No warranty, implied or explicit.

## BUILDING

You need a copy of ```chordii``` (which is available for *NIX/*BSD systems).
Then you just run ```make```. Simple.
