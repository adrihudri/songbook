{c: CAPO 3rd FRET}

[C] Tar[G]zan [C]wasn't a [G]ladies' man
[C]He'd just [G]come along and [C]scoop 'em up [G]under his [Em]arm
Like [D]that, [Em]quick as a [D]cat in the [Am]jungle [D]
But [C]Clark [G]Kent, now [C]there was a [G]real gent
[C] He would [G]not be caught [C]sittin' a[G]round in no
[Em]Jungle[D]scape, [Em]dumb as an [D]ape doing [Am]nothing [D]

{soc}
[C] Superman never [D]made any money
For [G]saving the world from [C]Solomon Grundy
[G]And sometimes [C]I despair the [G]world will never [C]see
Another [D]man like him
{eoc}

Hey Bob, Supe had a straight job
Even though he could have smashed through any bank
In the United States, he had the strength, but he would not
Folks said his family were all dead
Their planet crumbled but Superman, he forced himself
To carry on, forget Krypton, and keep going

[Em]Tar[D]zan was [Em]king of the [D]jungle and [C]Lord over all the [G]apes [D]
[Em]But [D]he could [Em]hardly [D]string together [C]four [G]words: "[C]I [G]Tarzan, You [D]Jane."

Sometimes when Supe was stopping crimes
I'll bet that he was tempted to just quit and turn his back
On man, join Tarzan in the forest
But he stayed in the city, and kept on changing clothes
In dirty old phonebooths till his work was through
And nothing to do but go on home

{c: CHORUS}

[G]
